# Send News - Article Hosting
See the live website [here!](https://tommysarticles.netlify.app/) 
(Don't mind the slow loading, it's hosted for free!)

## Welcome
This project provides the necessary components to host a mobile-compatible website, manipulating an [existing API](https://github.com/tyoung1738/nc-news-api) to provide users with existing articles, with the ability to sort, filter, add and remove comments. It also has built in error handling for client/server side errors. 

The project is styled in vanilla CSS and built using React. 

## Running the project locally

#### Requirements
Minimum Node.js version v21.4.0

In order to run the project locally:
1. Copy the .git URL
2. Find a suitable directory on your machine to store the project
3. In terminal, run the command ```git clone <repo-url>```
4. Open the file ```code .```
5. In order to see a version of the app hosted locally, try ```npm run dev``` and click the resulting link that appears in terminal

To deploy the website publicly, consider using a 3rd party hosting service such as [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/)
